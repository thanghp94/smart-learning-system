Create a comprehensive database admin panel for my Replit app that allows me to manage all tables in my PostgreSQL database. The admin panel should include the following features:

Core Requirements:
Dynamic Table Discovery: Automatically detect and list all tables in my database by querying the PostgreSQL information schema

CRUD Operations Interface: Create pages for each table that allow:

Create: Add new records with form validation

Read: View all records with pagination, sorting, and search functionality

Update: Edit existing records inline or through forms

Delete: Remove records with confirmation dialogs

SQL Query Runner: Include a dedicated page with a text area where I can write and execute custom SQL queries, displaying results in a formatted table

Enum Management System:

Detect columns with enum types

Provide an interface to add/remove enum values

Generate and execute ALTER TABLE statements automatically

Show current enum values for each column

Technical Implementation:
Use the existing DATABASE_URL environment variable from my Replit database connection

Create a /admin route structure with proper navigation

Implement proper error handling and user feedback

Use responsive design that works well in Replit's preview pane

Include confirmation dialogs for destructive operations (delete, alter table)

Security Features:
Add basic authentication (simple username/password is fine)

Implement SQL injection protection for all queries

Add audit logging for all database modifications

Include rollback capabilities where possible

User Interface Requirements:
Clean, spreadsheet-like interface similar to Replit's Database Editor

Breadcrumb navigation showing current table/operation

Real-time updates when data changes

Export functionality for table data (CSV format)

Bulk operations for multiple records

Additional Features:
Schema Viewer: Display table structures, column types, and relationships

Backup/Restore: Simple backup functionality for individual tables

Query History: Keep track of executed SQL queries

Performance Monitoring: Show query execution times

File Structure:
Create organized routes like:

/admin - Dashboard with table list

/admin/table/:tablename - CRUD operations for specific table

/admin/sql - SQL query runner

/admin/enums - Enum management interface

/admin/schema - Database schema viewer

Please create this admin panel step by step, starting with the basic table listing and CRUD operations, then adding the advanced features. Make sure to test each component thoroughly and ensure it integrates seamlessly with my existing Replit app.
